# Overview
Part of the [Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application) to build a basic inventory app using Node, Express and Mongoose.

The purpose of the project is to focus on creating an MVC application with some routes to add inventory, assign categories and enable users to either edit or delete products and categories.

## Learnings

It was great to get properly hands on with Node and I enjoyed learning about routing server side rendering. I did however find working with template engines (pug in my case) incredibly laborious. While they do support inline Javascript, it feels like you're fighting with the tool at times.


## Next Steps

Upcoming projects focus on using Express alongside React by creating APIs that the client can call and render. I'm looking forward to getting my hands back on React and think this will be a slightly cleaner full stack approach.

I've also done some reading around *Next.js* which allows you to run React on the server and it features a lot of Express functionality, e.g. routing and APIs. I'd like to explore this as an Express alternative in future that lets me run React across the entire stack.
